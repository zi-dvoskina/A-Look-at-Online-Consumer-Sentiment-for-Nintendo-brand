Using Google Trends, analyzed U.S. online search patterns for Nintendo, came up with possible reasons for search peaks and COVID-related patterns in the at-home entertainment market. Identified the top and the bottom states driving online search for the brand. Using regression analysis, discovered significant factors affecting online search for Nintendo: college, age and religiosity. Consumers search more about Nintendo if they are younger, less educated and less religious. Also compared search patterns of competing game consoles.

Using LIWC software for text analysis, monitored tone fluctuations in online chatter (tweets) about Nintendo brand and explored possible reasons for such patterns, such as holiday season. After data wrangling, created Tableau dashboards to identify states with most positive emotional tone, highest value consciousness, and user influence. Analyzed dominating emotions, motives, and topics in the tweets. 

Scraped online reviews from Amazon for the 3 consoles on the market and 3 best-selling games. Using R, filtered out generic words and created numerous wordclouds based on reviews, comparing the most mentioned words between types of products, product titles, ratings given, positive and negative tone. Identified the most popular reasons for complaints and compared ratings given by English-speaking consumers versus Spanish-speaking consumers. 

Based on additional data, made detailed segmentation analysis, chose the segments most worth targeting and created customer personas based on those segmentsâ€™ characteristics.
